It’s modular and has a build tool so you can generate a build that only includes the features you need. Sass is used for CSS, so you could easily customise the styles to suit your project.</p>

<p>Keyboard shortcuts are supported, the arrow keys and escape allow images to be navigated – see the gallery demo for an example of this.</p>

<p>A lot of the work is done by CSS, which means high DPI displays are supported:</p>

    <p> <i> Default controls are made with pure CSS, without external graphics. For the main image there is a built in way to provide appropriate source for different pixel density displays.</i>    </p>
